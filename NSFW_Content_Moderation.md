# Comparison of Solutions for NSFW Content Moderation (Images and Videos)

## 1. Selected Solutions
- **API4AI NSFW Recognition** (API)
- **Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch** (API)

## 2. Comparison Table

| Solution                  | Accuracy (NSFW) | Latency            | Cost                                              | Integration Simplicity  |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| API4AI NSFW Recognition   | ~92-95%         | ~300-600 ms/request| $7.50 per 10,000 requests/month, then from $0.00075| Medium (REST API)      |
| Google Cloud Vision       | ~93-96%         | ~500-800 ms/request| $1.50 per 1,000 requests                          | High (REST API, SDKs)  |

**Notes:**
- API4AI supports images; for videos, frames must be processed manually.
- Google Vision supports video via Video Intelligence API (separate pricing).

## 3. Recommendation

**I recommend API4AI NSFW Recognition** as the primary solution for moderating images and videos. Reasons:
- Good balance between accuracy, cost, and speed.
- Convenient integration via REST API.
- Transparent and affordable pricing policy.
- Scalability.

**Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch** is an excellent backup option with high accuracy and video support, suitable for large-scale projects and as a fallback.

**Important:** If you need enterprise solutions, higher SLA requirements, audit, support for complex moderation scenarios, or integration with other cloud services, it is recommended to use Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch as the main tool.

## 4. Fallback Mechanism

**How to implement fallback:**
1. Main flow: send images/videos (frames) to API4AI NSFW Recognition.
2. If the API is unavailable (network error, limits) or the result is "uncertain" (e.g., NSFW probability in the 0.4-0.6 range):
    - Send the same content to Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch.
3. If Google Cloud Vision is also unavailable or the result is also "uncertain" — forward to manual moderation.
4. Use the result of the fallback system to make a decision.

**Advantages:**
- Increased reliability.
- More confident decisions in "gray zones" and complex cases due to manual moderation.

**Conclusion:**
- For most tasks, it is optimal to use API4AI NSFW Recognition.
- For enterprise level, complex cases, and strict reliability requirements — switch to Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch.
